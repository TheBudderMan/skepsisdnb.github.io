Idk why, but writing in a C# script makes me feel better. Some of that hipster love I spose.

So with this cat game, we gotta start really focusing if we want to have something made before summer.

We need to trim down on scope and scale for the demo. 

Level and terrain will be pretty much done, with implied ideas for expansion into a city or other neighbourhood.

as we start to animate more, we also have to focus on implementing more level mechanics in the design of the walls and rest of the basement. 

That's probably the number one, finishing off the furniture and what you would be adding to the game in terms of what can be climbed on.

The main selling point is the cartoon aspect of the parkour kitty. All kitties can do parkour, they're fucking cats.

We have to start associating cat facts with the player mechanics. I wasn't okay with the cartoon fight animations at first, but it's actually okay.

so big thing today is, we can either figure out the animations for the humans and do more cinemachine and scene direction. 

we can work on enemy interactions and collision. 

If we're to do more cut scene animation we have to start implementing correct camera techniques, film people are easy to upset lol.

So I guess, what you actually need to do, is strip down the basement to only the basement and separate that into it's own scene.

I guess before that, we should actually separate the assets, like the walls and rooms.
